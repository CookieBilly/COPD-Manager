A dissertation project creating a COPD management application to help those struggling with COPD manage their symptoms and report any changes to a doctor, connected with their account. This application was created on behalf of a client, who will have meetings every 5 weeks to complete each SCRUM development sprint.

# 🤔 Why I chose this project?
> Explanation

# 📝 Requirement elicitation:
> - The system must allow patients to complete daily questions based on their health status in order to track their progress and give this information to the doctors for review.
> - The system must allow for direct communication between doctors and patients so doctors can ask further questions and discuss making gp appointments with patients.
> - The system must allow for the registration of doctors and patients: allowing them to register with a phone number which acts as a primary key.
> - The application must allow doctors to view all their patients. This means that they'd be able to click directly to patient history.
> - The application must match patients and doctors together, this means that one patient must have one doctor whilst doctors must have multiple patients.
> - The application must highlight any declining patients, this trend would be automatically detected by the application.
> - Doctors must be able to access patient history including chat history and answer history. This means that they cannot forget previous health answers and previous chat messages.
> - Doctors must be able to view historical patient data in a visual way. This means that they do not have to read blank data and instead can use graphs.
> - The application must track the patients progress over time, allowing doctors to easily monitor patients over a longer period.
> - Personal information of both doctors and patients must be editable by themselves
> - The application must give a daily push notification to remind patients to complete questions
> - The application must give a push notification to the doctors about a declining patient
> - Prototyping a step counter feature to be built within the application
